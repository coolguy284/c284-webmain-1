Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note:
  Parts taken from elsewhere and thus (probably) does not follow the same
  MIT+Unlicense as rest of repo:
    file "websites/public/misc/old/tools/systemdata.html", lines 96-190,
    file "proc_main/Dockerfile", lines 10-14, 17-20,
    file "proc_mongodb/Dockerfile", lines 10-14, 17-27,
    file "srv_web_main/Dockerfile", lines 12-16,
    file "srv_web_old/Dockerfile", lines 12-16,
    file "srv_web_old2/Dockerfile", lines 12-16,
    file "srv_web_oldg/Dockerfile", lines 12-16, lines 18-33,
    file "websites/public/chat/index.html", lines 65-66,
    file "websites/public/misc/service_worker.html" lines 45-50.
  
  Parts copied in from template and modified / copied many times so licensing
  unclear:
    file "srv_web_main/Dockerfile", lines 55-163,
    file "srv_web_old/Dockerfile", lines 20-36,
    file "srv_web_old2/Dockerfile", lines 22-38,
    file "srv_web_oldg/Dockerfile", lines 43-56.
  
  the files in "websites/public/libs/extern" that are there in the repo or
  appear there during docker build, are files from elsewhere that the repo-wide
  MIT+Unlicense license does not apply to. Only "README_original_urls.txt"
  is a file written by coolguy284 and thus follows the MIT+Unlicense license.
  
  the files in "websites/public/misc/old/js" are files from elsewhere that
  the repo-wide MIT+Unlicense license does not apply to.
