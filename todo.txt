add dalton unit to unit converter
internal library for unit conversion
periodic table / molecular db
fundamental particles db
rename debug to development

modtime of each html page should be the latest modtime of the script files / css files / favicon files / image / video files it contains
srv_web_main has memory leak? (851MiB after a month or two)
put a link to modtimes page and other config pages somewhere
halloween name generator should spookify when pressing enter on input (listen for onchange event? or maybe just the enter key being pressed?)
fix advancedtime and calculator table elems not having a tbody

make pefect mode for rectangles.html that covers the edges as well
add md5 hashing and old mds like md4 to sha hasher page
add chat page noscript tag (maybe calc page too)
make noscript tags fullwidth of page
add chdir to for top level index.js to ensure it always starts in the correct directory
add circles and ellipses and squares to rectangles.html
change advanced time "uncapped framerate" to say "full monitor framerate", also update on old site as well
on autogenerated unicode pages: add name of unicode character to title to make it match contents of h2 tag (this allows for better searchability in the browser, as page title can be used to provide suggestions)
re add windows index.ps1 and docker scripts
add draggability to solid color page items
  add 4 pixel group tiled colors to solid color page, maybe option to set tiling background image as well
link moving
  solid color page shouldnt be in debug, maybe as a main page link

rename /misc/status.html to /misc/server_status.html and add appropriate redirect
add blank line between end of head and beginning of body tag

tier 2:
rename /data/UnicodeData.txt to /unicode/UnicodeData.txt
add validator for canonical urls and meta urls, printing if they exist but do not match real url or if they are not equal
  validation for meta description tags, to supplement validation for canonical urls
  can implement in helpers/main.js, either print as a warning (probably) or an error (maybe)
  also validator to make sure "to" urls in redirects.txt are the final form of the url for the most part
use map and promise all for git log and others or for none of them
store node-server and other repositories directly in the code, docker build scripts auto clone or update them
api endpoint that sends a 204 and a non standard date header with extra precision
add creation time file in addition to modtimes file, maybe an api to get full date information, or sending extra date info as headers if a certain header is in request
website with css transforms and animations

tier 3:
enigma machine and other sites in tools and other from the old site

mongodb figure out why replica set necessary and fix
replace string startswith checks followed by string slicing with regex matching (ex. srv_web_main/helpers/main.js lines 69-70)

http.coolguy284.com or insecure.coolguy284.com
  implement by adding a works with http flag that must be turned on for each page that works with http, otherwise a 404 is sent
  api endpoints also should be marked as working on insecure or not
  also add unencrypted and encrypted http2 upgrade
fix all docker containers getting a sigint simultaneously when proc_main one does
make more lib/extern copied from node_modules in dockerfile
old sites
  dompurify to old node chat
  bring back important
  make wm1, ns, nsn work as subfolder on website, meaning change html and js files to not use absolute paths
  update github repos description urls once hosted
  check whether oldg really needs external links warning
potential put srv_web_main through readline stream and add on timestamp and "[main]" if message has no identifiers otherwise
http2 websocket 404 strange behavior
add sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and others to debug pages, basically all currently unlinked pages
  do the same in node srv, node srv new, c284 git io
make proxies disconnect other end if one end closes, forward errors as well
  make socketLink function in common that does all this to prevent code duplication
  if http proxy res function is given already complete res it will hang and not close socket and browser will load indefinitely as well

create_sitemap return lastmod and other properties, also return array of objects instead of map
nosniff and other headers of the same nature should appear everywhere
allow main code folder and main data secrets folder to be anywhere and make scripts use a relative path to reference them
add alt code to unicode pages
new systemdata has 2 options, one is tab view other is dropdown view like old

medium concepts:
add nested layers of indexes for unicode
add privacy policy
  if cannot do legally rigorous privacy policy yet cause of lack of knowledge, then do simple hard fact data description privacy policy until then
fancier latency test and time syncer, less NaN
add no javascript banner to all pages that use javascript in the slightest
add warnings to encrypting, decrypting, hashing, etc. to not use for security purposes
improve localstorage editor cookies handling
add description to more misc pages
sitemap gen proper html parser and proper parsing of urls
sitemap changefreq based on lastmod (maybe)
add adblock detector site (for fun)
chat empty string should show up as anonymous
chat, echo, status websockets should have proper server close exit code and server close procedure where client closes, instead of force close

  maybe a public or api keyed js api to make any http query
add comments to wm1 code
rework docs on wm1, make docs accessible as wm1 subpage, link to all docs from main doc or subdocs
make sure each page in docs is fully up to date and add more pages as necessary
auto sitemap generator (limit 1 query per website per ip every hour, and limit 20 queries per website per hour)
add strange files page, with weird zips and wims and stuff
status garden with api endpoints or regular endpoints for every http status code
potentially put old sites in archive tab which links to a page with detailed explanations of all of them
use fs.promises and async for everything possible

make misc index proper
  add tweaks made to regular index to it as well like fix version footer rendering issue and update stylesheet and inline style to match index
add top navbar to base64 site and other tools sites and other parts of website in general
  should be in format of coolguy284.com (right arrow) tools (right arrow) base64 encoder; all 3 parts are links
  should have same background color as index page navbar
add waveform gen and other repl sites to website
possibly live website_data.txt evaluating because of unicode characters pages, should be marked no crawl at first but will need to send that header
experiment with wiki stuff
add /misc/trail which is a page with status code 451, links to other stuff if bypassed (by setting ?location=space&admin=true), 1 layer deep it will say trail ends here for now until extended
  when location is set the page says location "location" is not valid, when not set it defaults to something
implement altsvc and http3 support
when chrome supports level 4 media queries remove comment in encode_decode.html
way to live update server code during development without need for docker rebuild, either update and rerun inside docker or live patch while running, which would require everything to be made very modular
/api/echo/headers subfolder support
api ipv6 error if ipv4, unless parameter usemapped is set to true

  eventually add suggestions page and suggestions db maybe email notif or some other form of notif
  maybe suggestions page linked from todo or just part of todo or maybe just by itself
  add wm pages for all current github redirects in redirects.txt
mongodb reverse proxy upgrades
  take in nodejs ipc comm instead and calls mongo client funcs to abstract away perms, but still add users and perms to mongodb anyway and use them
  maybe seperate proc_mongodbpass w. reverse proxy for password db
  forward stdin query commands to mongodb
proc main use docker daemon to get cpu, mem, net, disk io (maybe) of all wm1 processes and sends it to main server proc and is shown on status page
  stats recorded every minute
add brotli to oldg and future nginx servers
maybe update oldg to look better on mobile (also misc/rectangles)
/misc/old temp pages need to be updated and then removed from the temp pages

page with custom mouse that is one pixel
idea of having progress bar above textbox with a character or word limit, maybe a very thin progress bar that has no margin between it and textbox
unselectable radiobuttons
website with absolute jsonized list of all elements and a bunch of molecules in searchable table form
  supporting isotopes, isomers, allotropes, polymorphs; price per kilo or gram or pound or whatever unit (using my unit converter code but made more portable)
  ability to compare between 2 elements or molecules (useful for comparing prices of silver, gold, diamond, iridium, etc.; should have different values for natural and synthetic, for diamond specifically but possibly others)
the ability to have short abbreviations for sites, e.g. /at for advanced time, most likely using temporary redirects

big concepts:
hex editor
english words searcher
add pseudo live birth and death tracker that is not linear but instead has realistic randomness in the timing, also maybe other events, also random names
convert server to restful api
add /api/help endpoint that explains api endpoints
  explains /chat/ws and future chat endpoints as well, or points to a /chat/docs endpoint that explains the same
logs reform, make all logged requests debug and turn off debug, put basic info (ip and url) into seperate file for processing and conversion to aggregate format
  beginner log reform is hide ip and maybe url or more from main log, make addl log that doesnt have terminal formatting characters that does have the info, then think of how to collate into url accessed in country and per operating system thing like old server viewshist
  defer log debug tcp and tls until request sent unless debug_log_req_always on
    if no request sent assume priv mode unless debug_log_req_always (although check shouldnt be necessary)
  handle logs though proc main, proc main sends them to proc mongodb for storing, and mongodb handles deletion and aggregation every 24*30*60 minutes or every server tick
  delete logs after 30 days, only aggregate after then, no exceptions, including all legacy data
add website version to status, maybe also add more things
  add cpu and mem and bunch of other things
  maybe vps name and info
  maybe vps cost and domain name cost
  avg requests per second
  limited request info like approx number of times url accessed
  total page visits today and total all time; also total unique visitors today and all time
  all things in status page should have complete historical data available if it makes sense to do so, compressed with xz
rename qr code to qr code generator and make qr code reader
converter or smth w. encodings, textboxes, n other stuff and contenteditable div, more general version of base64/url/uricomp etc, but also horizontal instead of vertical
random number gens and testing suites
optional service worker for caching and testing
finish unicode viewer and link it
  putting single char in shows that char as unicode entry first thing, insta search all substring, entry as tall as form box for room for enlarged unicode char, alternative view where each one is a cell
  unicode searcher might have external link icon at right instead of whole thing being link, to aid text selectability without being annoying, maybe make it a check on top (below search bar, above results)
  checkbox on top for collapse unallocated characters (converts range into double or triple high cell or single high cell with different visual somehow like slightly darker background, that says its a range), also checkbox for collapse allocated ranges (like surrogates), both checked by default
    possibly make unalloc checkbox first one that if off will disable second one (still interactable but greyed out and does nothing)
opencloudhash and cloudhash (csprng based fake hash using database, with api for access), opencloudhash has hash entries visible, cloudhash does not
xampp subfolder /x, wordpress subfolder /x/w
user account system
  user flags int, first bit is admin flag
  maybe gives access to precise viewshist
  also standard admin console as well
  add simple todo list functionality to my website as part of user account (optionally, for sync)
  some sort of keyring to store end to end encrypted keys and other things
  option to set selectability of UI text in chat and other places, as a global setting for all webpages on site, tied to user account, default is not selectable, can be set to selectable or selectable with selection dissappearing after x seconds, minutes
    also makes ctrl-a only select content area if set to not selectable, such as code area for online ide
    optional override for each specific ui type or specific ui element
  when default settings on anything that is part of user account system changed, popup for do you want to keep your settings or go with new default
    popup has "remember this decision" checkmark, and below it an option box saying "for x", like "for 1 month", "for 1 year", "forever", etc.
  list of current sessions with options to end them and also has past sessions that have closed, kept for a long time like 6 months to ensure they are not missed and also cannot be removed to ensure if someone gets on account they are audited; past sessions off by default
    ability to turn on deleting of old sessions but it audits the turning on and off; auditing off by default
      ability to turn off auditing and delete old audits
  browser that created account is root of trust, can authorize other sessions (or 2fa can authorize them) in order to authorize them as root of trust as well, and can enable the extreme auditing of old sessions and user settings changes, but it is off by default
  ability to ipban or ban block or ban user acc from certain actions for a certain period of time automatically for certain actions and manually
  auditing actions forgot after 6mo or some similar period and are cleared from record after similar period (acc can view their own bans until they are forgot)
  data viewer page that can even be accessed without an account, allows editing or deleting of each and every data entry on the site, or requesting of not using data for certain purposes which brings up a popup stating that the data will simply be deleted (or maybe it can be moved to a private location where nobody else can see it but can be moved back to a public location at user's choice)
add open declaration of password security and data handling (when its time)
chat system
  option to send as markdown, bbcode, or html
  voice upgrades
    colored server mutes
    text, voice, raw data thru voice (or maybe data channels), inputs keyboard mouse controller etc sent to bot and output stream from bot (thru voice channel)
    ability to see whether people can see livestream and what their latency to it is
    ability to mute or cutoff video on livestream, same for audio
      mute just hides but cutoff stops receiving traffic
      but for convenience mute can do that too unless disabled in client setting
    ability for a bot to join auto client muted by everyone (although a seperate client mute than the normal one, like client suppress)
    total list of mutes/deafens on other people:
      side: client or server side
      type: mute or deafen
      category: audio, video, stream, data (can merge categories client side or server side)
      value: perm off, temp off, inherit, temp on, perm on (inherit copies value from channel permissions and is the default, temp off is how to for example let someone speak in a channel they normally cannot, temp values go away when user leaves voice (but can be set when user not in voice as a preemptive), perm values persist)
      value inherit can be changed in server settings to be split into two values, inherit (which will insta update when channel permissions update) and inherit once (which will be calculated on channel join and will not change), or to make the single option version of inherit behave like inherit once instead
      when adjusting voice permissions to prevent a user from doing something, a prompt will appear saying whether they want to set everyone in vc to temp off (only if server is set to not use inherit once for inherit behavior)
      mutes/deafens can be edited when user not in voice channel as well
      server setting for whether client deafens of a user that is not you will have effect (i.e. preventing them and only them from hearing your voice, camera, etc.)
    mutes/deafens on self:
      client mute: prevents transmitting audio out from self client side, normally linked to a visual client mute which shows others you are doing so but can be decoupled in client settings
      client deafen: prevents receiving audio from others client side, normally linked to a visual client mute which shows others you are doing so but can be decoupled in client settings
      pseudo server mute: prevents transmitting audio out from self server side, forces a visual client mute server side so others know you are guaranteed to be doing so and cannot secretly speak
      pseudo server deafen: prevents receiving audio from others self server side, forces a visual client mute server side so others know you are guaranteed to be doing so and cannot secretly hear
      client mute/deafen and pseudo server action of the same type are normally linked but can be decoupled client side (although that would appear suspicious)
      can turn off client mute if it is turned on even if server mute is turned on, there is no gui preventing such an action
    client actions:
      audio (default on), video (default off), stream (default off, can be on multiple times aka many different streams), raw data (default off)
      defaults can be changed in settings
      in settings deafen can be configured to auto mute as well
    client side servers that can pull channels from other servers
    ability to client side reorder channels in servers
    zoom in on stream or facecam on mobile or pc
    stream pop out windows can be set to a particular stream, main window can be split into regions with seperate views and so can pop out
    stream multiple monitors either as seperate streams or as one big stream (which makes zooming imperative); special mode to fullscreen to multiple screens at once with a multiple screen livestream, or to split the livestream into many seperate windows and fullscreen each one independently
    can set audio of stream to a specific application, even if streaming desktop; or to desktop if streaming a specific application
  embed ideas
    ability to add datetimes to middle of chat message and have them render in user's timezone
    other such processed elements like that or even active elements
    date could also appear in calendar form or countdown form as an embed
    maybe not called an embed but instead a more loose term, or instead embeds could have many types, such as title and desc, calendar, stopwatch, iframe, etc
    website embeds show website small with button to make large and another button to open in new tab (or open in browser in general if c++ client used) which also appears in large view
    embeds can appear at bottom of message or inside middle of message
  arbitrary kv pairs on msgs, user, channel, member, server, etc
  instant caching of image links and website iframe embed creating links sent, and showing the cached version, to protect end user ip
  c++ client for chat and for rest of website in a general sense
  make a visual stream of text messages with occasional embeds visually appealing
  option to put certain channels into a check later folder to save their messages for later, then can check the current msgs in the channel the normal way and the earlier ones can be checked later on by checking the check later folder
  client or server side regex replacement of messages (server side in server specific settings)
  server side fake permissions drop, better than client side roles removed, but also configurable extra permissions drop not related to roles
  option to replace numbers with word versions, 4 with four
  option to configure representation of dates and times, but maybe more than one configuration cause dates can be on message, in audit log, etc
  add ability to client side set user's pfp to previous one or another one entirely or just a nothing, same for usernames
  servers and channels can have pfps
  servers and channels on the left panels have pfp on left and name on right in their div, server pick panel is on left, channel pick is on left but is right of server pick
  remove characters near enter like "\" that are pressed right before enter key is pressed, configurable in settings
  sending link to message causes message to appear below it as embed
  message links can be made to not have id of channel or anything in it, and just use message id only or random id only
  setting that will swap "l" and "I" and "|" randomly with each other, either once or every second
  things after and before colon are the words that will be used on website UI
  Video Codec: How video frames become file bytes.
    Auto: Uses most space efficient codec that still works effectively.
      default
    H.264: Good ol' reliable. Not very space efficient, but works on every device.
    H.265: Newer H.264. Less filesize, but more licensing restrictions :(
    AV1: Very small filesize, but very slow as GPUs do not support the codec yet.
    descriptions are in smaller text below each option
  end to end encrypted is default for direct messages
  3 levels of encryption for servers (automatically applies to all channels), channels, and messages
    no encryption
    hashed password symmetric encryption
    end to end keyring symmetric encryption maybe with ecdh key distribution or something
  the 3 levels of encryption can also be set on voice channels and other channel types as well
  channel encryption can be set to only message content (so unencrypted author field and other fields are guaranteed valid (if you trust the server)) or set to all metadata as well (channel just becomes an array of encrypted binary blobs at that point and author fields can be forged)
  handle dst time changes in timestamps properly (for a timestamp that occurs after fall back time but before fall back, show as "first fold", if after fall back, show as "second fold"; show as a label after the timestamp); also dont make simple mistake of showing daylight time timestamps in standard time after time change
  special message components editable by everyone
    ability to lock the special components to only be editable by sender
  ability to toggle on a don't send mode which makes enter key add newline to msg instead
  overflow menu in chat box for more niche features
  ability to enable mods editing messages thru edit others messages permission (it will say edited by moderator)
    people can set server wide or global to not allow messages to be edited, and to make exceptions for a certain message
    this might not be used much anyway because of edit requests
  ability to send edit requests on a message and to approve them or to auto approve or to auto approve but show as edited by the person who sent the request
  permissions can still be bitfield but stored as base64 string because potentially hundreds of bits
  ctrl-a can be configured to open ctrl-a dialog to choose what gets selected, so custom message range, select usernames as well, select timestamps, etc.
  p2p fully e2e encrypted voice channels by default or by choice idk
  ability to set server member whitelist so its almost like an auto ban for everyone else
  ability to reply to 2 or more messages at once, or messages from a different channel or even different server or dm
  ability to set scrolling behavior
    show entire chat history at once and have miniscule scrollbar
    have scrollbar that only scrolls 300ish messages, and snaps back to middle with reset middle position when moved to the edge
    have bar for whole thing but it is visual, actual scrollbar is interactive circle object that if moved a little bit down will scroll at constant speed, faster for more distance from center, likewise for scrolling up; resets to center if unclicked
  truly non-account messages will stay as they are now (editable by anyone that pretends to have that name), however a new type of non-account message, one that is linked to a real account or to a autocreated account, called a custom name message (autocreated account is account that is tied to cookies and will be lost on cookies cleared and will be deleted after not using for 90 days (default, configurable), unless the autocreated account is tied to a real account (default never delete then, but also configurable))
    autocreated account custom name messages can be set on account deletion to delete (default) or to convert to truly non-account messages (with optionally changing name to something else or deleted user or modifying name based on a formula applied to each message)
  regular account messages can be set on account deletion to delete (default) or to convert to truly non-account message with the same name as original user or deleted user or another name or change name on a formula applied to each message
  profile picture support in any image format, png, jpg, webp, jxl, svg, bmp; gif, apng, mp4, mkv, mov, avi for animated
    radiobuttons for level of data preservation
      preserving exact image metadata (but beware uploading geolocation data)
      strip all metadata, preserve image bytes
      strip all metadata, compress image losslessly within same image filetype as much as possible
      strip all metadata, compress image losslessly to filetype with lowest size (usually jxl, although due to lack of browser support a cached webp will be stored as well for like 24 hours or smth) (default)
      or optionally compress losslessly, when clicked options will appear for format and compression level
  the ability to dm urself (good as a todo list)
  get a notification when someone goes online/offline/idle/dnd
  ability to right click on someone and ping them to check if they're actually online, checks if their client responds to the ping within 5 seconds
social media
  by default nothing is used for any analytics
  if there are analytic requests (for someone's likeness or something) for some reason, they are asked thru notifs (auto denied after a while)
    requests for accepting tagging you in an image (possibly created by someone else), and other ai reasons or other reasons, and a different prompt for each reason, all opt in by default
    on the prompt, there is accept or deny of course, but also checkbox for remember this decision, which has a select below it that says "for this content creator", "for all posts" (can also say for whatever other message types there are), and "for everything"
  images posted by someone that have someone else in them can be removed by the someone else if they don't consent
spaces
  universes, zones, simple objects and physical simulation regions
production ready xampp site, self hosted github equiv, all of which are accessible as subfolders on main or their own seperate domain, in future self hosted git might be main git that i use and thus wont be proxied through srv web main but hosted seperately, but only that hosted seperately
request explorer site where you can create arbitrary http requests to urls on the server, make and close http1.1 and http2 connections, http/https, and even send data through websocket connections
multipart range header support and support for reading and responding with multiparts in other circumstances as well
commenter website where you can comment on a site if the site has no comment functionality by default
  but maybe not if the site owner has an explicit reason not to
  site owner can later add it as an iframe if they want
make mobile app for some features of website like todo list and chat and maybe a general browser for site as well (excuse to reimplement base64 converter or whatever in java or c++)
  also pc app with similar functionalities
make blog as a test of storing pages in a database instead of in the code
auto generated picture service, with view counter, or just picture with certain width and color; also maybe some sort of iframe service
cloud storage service
  properly handles symlinks and hardlinks, etc., and stores them as expected
  handles all metadata, including filetimes and alternate streams (stored in cloud as special files with filenames with colon after to be more linux like, but the special files cannot have any metadata at all, and are marked as streams of original)
    should also preserve files archive bit and readonly bit (preserving the bits is optional, in case a program sets the archive bit)
  option to support client side encryption (so server just stores a single encrypted blob for entire filesystem with no data on what files or even the filesystem that is inside) and possibly use user account keyring for it
corrections api, ability to request a correction, however minor, on any page of the site, internally creates a suggestion on the suggestions / feedback db

extra:
experiment with unsorted readdirs using fuse, if works potential necessity to sort c284-webmain-1 modtimes.json or maybe just sort it anyway

low priority:
add text lines sorter page using contenteditable div
general: update packages (on old servers also), user acc system
advanced time:
  consolidate localstorage keys on advancedtime
make docker build args into single file
calculator: add variable aliases for nil, None, missing, etc.

prob not doing:
complex redirect chaining
  process all file redirects and folder redirects so that one redirect's to can be another's from but they both get set to redirect to the another's to (redirect chaining)
    processed at docker build time instead of at runtime so the redirects.txt at runtime is indentical to how it will be after the above statement is done
    and it errors at buildtime if a cycle is detected (including complex cycles caused by a folder and a file redirect together)
  then convert current redirects in file to chain instead of all pointing to the final destination
  redirect chaining processed in order they appear in file

problems:
proc_main index.js seems to stay running if one of sibling docker containers started by it is still running

notes:
