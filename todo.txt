env var for no logging
allow /misc/unicode/U+ urls with less digits than 4 (redirect to proper canonical version as usual)
api ipv6 error if ipv4, unless parameter usemapped is set to true
use map and promise all for git log and others or for none of them
add website flag for sending a x-robots-tag of noindex with the page, and set flag for /misc/debug/templates/

fix website index too tall when webbrowser is tall
potential put srv_web_main through readline stream and add on timestamp and "[main]" if message has no identifiers otherwise
update options method responses
http2 websocket 404 strange behavior
add sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and others to debug pages, basically all currently unlinked pages
  do the same in node srv, node srv new, c284 git io
make proxies disconnect other end if one end closes, forward errors as well
  make socketLink function in common that does all this to prevent code duplication
  if http proxy res function is given already complete res it will hang and not close socket and browser will load indefinitely as well
create_sitemap return lastmod and other properties, also return array of objects instead of map

make more lib/extern copied from node_modules in dockerfile

old sites
  make old and maybe old2 not use polling, probably use eventsource instead
    dompurify to old node chat
  bring back important
  make wm1, ns, nsn work as subfolder on website, meaning change html and js files to not use absolute paths
  maybe add coolguy284.github.io to site as well
  update github repos description urls once hosted

add validator for canonical urls and meta urls, printing if they exist but do not match real url or if they are not equal
fix all docker containers getting a sigint simultaneously when proc_main one does

http.coolguy284.com or insecure.coolguy284.com
  implement by adding a works with http flag that must be turned on for each page that works with http, otherwise a 404 is sent
  api endpoints also should be marked as working on insecure or not
  also add unencrypted and encrypted http2 upgrade

don't use recursion for recursive readdir or sitemap get (fix both on both wm1 and zextra)
copy over wm1 changes to zextra scripts
copied over bson and other libs/extern should have version in title so webpages are guaranteed to request latest version instead of caching
more advanced redirection logic so /misc/unicode redirects are bunched in with the rest of redirects.txt, not in the file but in the same http response
mongodb figure out why replica set necessary and fix

add nested layers of indexes for unicode
add /unicode/random for link to random unicode character
add privacy policy
add base64_url encoder/decoder
fancier latency test and time syncer, less NaN
validation for meta description tags, to supplement validation for canonical urls
  also validator to make sure "to" urls in redirects.txt are the final form of the url for the most part
add no javascript banner to all pages that use javascript in the slightest
add warnings to encrypting, decrypting, hashing, etc. to not use for security purposes
improve localstorage editor cookies handling
add description to more misc pages
sitemap gen proper html parser and proper parsing of urls
sitemap changefreq based on lastmod (maybe)
add adblock detector site (for fun)
chat empty string should show up as anonymous
chat, echo, status websockets should have proper server close exit code and server close procedure where client closes, instead of force close
add alternate webpage access url /api/page?page=<url> or /api/page?page_b64=<b64_url> endpoint with optional &replace_internal_urls=true
  forward headers and call request func with headers, except maybe not forward last modified
  possible future support for full urls for proxy like instead of just server urls
  possible tie in to virtual browser
  maybe a public or api keyed js api to make any http query
add comments to wm1 code
rework docs on wm1, make docs accessible as wm1 subpage, link to all docs from main doc or subdocs
make sure each page in docs is fully up to date and add more pages as necessary
enigma machine and other sites in tools and other from the old site
auto sitemap generator (limit 1 query per website per ip every hour, and limit 20 queries per website per hour)
add strange files page, with weird zips and wims and stuff
status garden with api endpoints or regular endpoints for every http status code
potentially put old sites in archive tab which links to a page with detailed explanations of all of them
use fs.promises and async for everything possible
potentially add more multi page auto generated pages like unicode
make misc index proper
replace string startswith checks followed by string slicing with regex matching (ex. srv_web_main/helpers/main.js lines 69-70) 
add top navbar to base64 site and other tools sites and rest of website
add waveform gen and other repl sites to website
possibly live website_data.txt evaluating because of unicode characters pages, should be marked no crawl at first but will need to send that header
experiment with wiki stuff
add /misc/trail which is a page with status code 451, links to other stuff if bypassed (by setting ?location=space&admin=true), 1 layer deep it will say trail ends here for now until extended
  when location is set the page says location "location" is not valid, when not set it defaults to something
implement altsvc and http3 support
when chrome supports level 4 media queries remove comment in encode_decode.html
way to live update server code during development without need for docker rebuild, either update and rerun inside docker or live patch while running, which would require everything to be made very modular

hex editor
english words searcher
add pseudo live birth and death tracker that is not linear but instead has realistic randomness in the timing, also maybe other events, also random names
convert server to restful api
add /api/help endpoint that explains api endpoints
  explains /chat/ws and future chat endpoints as well, or points to a /chat/docs endpoint that explains the same
logs reform, make all logged requests debug and turn off debug, put basic info (ip and url) into seperate file for processing and conversion to aggregate format
  beginner log reform is hide ip and maybe url or more from main log, make addl log that doesnt have terminal formatting characters that does have the info, then think of how to collate into url accessed in country and per operating system thing like old server viewshist
add website version to status, maybe also add more things
rename qr code to qr code generator and make qr code reader
converter or smth w. encodings, textboxes, n other stuff and contenteditable div, more general version of base64/url/uricomp etc, but also horizontal instead of vertical
random number gens and testing suites
optional service worker for caching and testing
finish unicode viewer and link it
opencloudhash and cloudhash (csprng based fake hash using database, with api for access), opencloudhash has hash entries visible, cloudhash does not
xampp subfolder /x, wordpress subfolder /x/w
user account system
add open declaration of password security and data handling (when its time)
chat upgrades
  option to send as markdown, bbcode, or html
  text, voice, raw data thru voice (or maybe data channels), inputs keyboard mouse controller etc sent to bot and output stream from bot (thru voice channel)
  arbitrary kv pairs on msgs, user, channel, member, server, etc
  colored server mutes
  ability to see whether people can see livestream and what their latency to it is
spaces
  universes, zones, simple objects and physical simulation regions
production ready xampp site, self hosted github equiv, all of which are accessible as subfolders on main or their own seperate domain, in future self hosted git might be main git that i use and thus wont be proxied through srv web main but hosted seperately, but only that hosted seperately
request explorer site where you can create arbitrary http requests to urls on the server, make and close http1.1 and http2 connections, http/https, and even send data through websocket connections
multipart range header support and support for reading and responding with multiparts in other circumstances as well

extra:
experiment with unsorted readdirs using fuse, if works potential necessity to sort c284-webmain-1 modtimes.json or maybe just sort it anyway

problems:
if there is a unicode url it can be redirected by the default redirect code and the unicode code one at a time
proc_main index.js seems to stay running if one of sibling docker containers started by it is still running

notes:
srv_web_main/common/url_valid_check.js has hardcoded 2 functions from common (since it must be able to run independently)
