copied over bson and other libs/extern should have version in title so webpages are guaranteed to request latest version instead of caching
mongodb figure out why replica set necessary and fix
replace string startswith checks followed by string slicing with regex matching (ex. srv_web_main/helpers/main.js lines 69-70)
proper websocket closure with server closure, echo and status ws should just close all connections immediately, chat ws should send chat exit packet (maybe statusws can do the same)
http.coolguy284.com or insecure.coolguy284.com
  implement by adding a works with http flag that must be turned on for each page that works with http, otherwise a 404 is sent
  api endpoints also should be marked as working on insecure or not
  also add unencrypted and encrypted http2 upgrade

add warnings to encrypting, decrypting, hashing, etc. to not use for security purposes
improve localstorage editor cookies handling
add description to more misc pages
sitemap gen proper html parser and proper parsing of urls
sitemap changefreq based on lastmod (maybe)
add adblock detector site (for fun)
chat empty string should show up as anonymous
chat, echo, status websockets should have proper server close exit code and server close procedure where client closes, instead of force close

add strange files page, with weird zips and wims and stuff
status garden with api endpoints or regular endpoints for every http status code
potentially put old sites in archive tab which links to a page with detailed explanations of all of them
use fs.promises and async for everything possible
potentially add more multi page auto generated pages like unicode
make misc index proper
add top navbar to base64 site and other tools sites and rest of website
add waveform gen and other repl sites to website
possibly live website_data.txt evaluating because of unicode characters pages, should be marked no crawl at first but will need to send that header
experiment with wiki stuff
add /misc/trail which is a page with status code 451, links to other stuff if bypassed (by setting ?location=space&admin=true), 1 layer deep it will say trail ends here for now until extended
  when location is set the page says location "location" is not valid, when not set it defaults to something
implement altsvc and http3 support
when chrome supports level 4 media queries remove comment in encode_decode.html
way to live update server code during development without need for docker rebuild, either update and rerun inside docker or live patch while running, which would require everything to be made very modular
/api/echo/headers subfolder support
api ipv6 error if ipv4, unless parameter usemapped is set to true
add env vars for http, https, http2 enabled

convert server to restful api
add /api/help endpoint that explains api endpoints
  explains /chat/ws and future chat endpoints as well, or points to a /chat/docs endpoint that explains the same
logs reform, make all logged requests debug and turn off debug, put basic info (ip and url) into seperate file for processing and conversion to aggregate format
  beginner log reform is hide ip and maybe url or more from main log, make addl log that doesnt have terminal formatting characters that does have the info, then think of how to collate into url accessed in country and per operating system thing like old server viewshist
add website version to status, maybe also add more things
rename qr code to qr code generator and make qr code reader
converter or smth w. encodings, textboxes, n other stuff and contenteditable div, more general version of base64/url/uricomp etc, but also horizontal instead of vertical
random number gens and testing suites
optional service worker for caching and testing
finish unicode viewer and link it
  putting single char in shows that char as unicode entry first thing, insta search all substring, entry as tall as form box for room for enlarged unicode char, alternative view where each one is a cell
opencloudhash and cloudhash (csprng based fake hash using database, with api for access), opencloudhash has hash entries visible, cloudhash does not

spaces
  universes, zones, simple objects and physical simulation regions

request explorer site where you can create arbitrary http requests to urls on the server, make and close http1.1 and http2 connections, http/https, and even send data through websocket connections
multipart range header support and support for reading and responding with multiparts in other circumstances as well

extra:
experiment with unsorted readdirs using fuse, if works potential necessity to sort c284-webmain-1 modtimes.json or maybe just sort it anyway

problems:
proc_main index.js seems to stay running if one of sibling docker containers started by it is still running

notes:
srv_web_main/common/url_valid_check.js has hardcoded 2 functions and 1 set from common (since it must be able to run independently)
srv_web_main/log_utils.js has hardcoded 1 function from common (since it runs first)
