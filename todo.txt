unarchive node-server-new to make common flags http and https server be related to common.port and common.porttls, also make common port and porttls default to null, null meaning server won't get run; either this or make common flags http and https into environment variables, probably this latter as it matches the code style more
  check how well node-server and node-server-new handle sigints
  update each server's github repo to deny all in their robots txt since they are old sites, see if a flag can be added to robots.txt explaining why disallow
  implement x-robots-tag: noindex header to all 3 servers, but for wm1 only in /old and /old2 subdirs (forwards headers from the server but also adds in the x-robots-tag header, until the server is updated to send the header itself)
  crlf and all eslint checks on all 3 servers
  maybe add coolguy284.github.io to site as well
  update github repos description urls once hosted

old.coolguy284.com and coolguy284.com/old
  add old and old2 to index as addl links
  possibly /old-node-server and /old-node-server-new instead of /old and /old2 but possibly just explained in index
  change old site link in 404 to old site
  make old and maybe old2 not use polling, probably use eventsource instead
    dompurify to old node chat
  add external links warning to index for old and old2

fix all docker containers getting a sigint simultaneously when proc_main one does

http.coolguy284.com or insecure.coolguy284.com

add no javascript banner to all pages that use javascript in the slightest
add warnings to encrypting, decrypting, hashing, etc. to not use for security purposes
improve localstorage editor cookies handling
add description to more misc pages
sitemap lastmod from git repo, changefreq based on lastmod (maybe)
add adblock detector site (for fun)
chat empty string should show up as anonymous
chat, echo, status websockets should have proper server close exit code and server close procedure where client closes, instead of force close
add alternate webpage access url /api/page?page=<url> or /api/page?page_b64=<b64_url> endpoint with optional &replace_internal_urls=true
  forward headers and call request func with headers, except maybe not forward last modified
  possible future support for full urls for proxy like instead of just server urls
  possible tie in to virtual browser
  maybe a public or api keyed js api to make any http query
make docs accessible on website
enigma machine and other sites in tools and other from the old site
auto sitemap generator (limit 1 query per website per ip every hour, and limit 20 queries per website per hour)
add strange files page, with weird zips and wims and stuff

hex editor
english words searcher
add pseudo live birth and death tracker that is not linear but instead has realistic randomness in the timing, also maybe other events, also random names
convert server to restful api
add /api/help endpoint that explains api endpoints
  explains /chat/ws and future chat endpoints as well, or points to a /chat/docs endpoint that explains the same
logs reform, make all logged requests debug and turn off debug, put basic info (ip and url) into seperate file for processing and conversion to aggregate format
add website version to status, maybe also add more things
rename qr code to qr code generator and make qr code reader
converter or smth w. encodings, textboxes, n other stuff and contenteditable div, more general version of base64/url/uricomp etc, but also horizontal instead of vertical
random number gens and testing suites
optional service worker for caching and testing
finish unicode viewer and link it
opencloudhash and cloudhash (csprng based fake hash using database, with api for access), opencloudhash has hash entries visible, cloudhash does not
xampp subfolder /x, wordpress subfolder /x/w

problems:
if there is a unicode url it can be redirected by the default redirect code and the unicode code one at a time
proc_main index.js seems to stay running if one of sibling docker containers started by it is still running
